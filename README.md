## Why Coffee & Code?

> [!note] Perfect Pairing
> Coffee and programming go hand in hand. Both require attention to detail, precise measurements, and a passion for crafting something amazing.

> [!tip] Productivity Boost
> Studies show that moderate coffee consumption can improve focus and problem-solving abilities. Just remember to stay hydrated!

> [!warning] Coffee First, Code Later
> Never attempt to debug production issues before your morning coffee. Trust us on this one! 

> [!danger] Common Pitfalls
> - Over-caffeination leads to jittery coding
> - Cold coffee = cold code
> - Running out of beans during a coding sprint
